<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works' were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language". His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced". In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich œuvre, which embraced imagination as "the body of God",[6] or "human existence itself".</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings are today part of collections such as part of Romantic movement as “Pre-Romantic”.[8] In fact he has been said to be “a key early proponent both Romanticism Nationalism”.[9] A committed Christian who was hostile to Church England (indeed all forms organized religion),[10][11] Though later rejected many these political beliefs maintained amiable relationship political activist Thomas Paine; also influenced thinkers such Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences singularity makes him difficult classify.
